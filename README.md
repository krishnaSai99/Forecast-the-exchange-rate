# Forecast-the-exchange-rate

The project involved preprocessing historical exchange rate data (INR, Euro, Pound) using Pandas and NumPy, followed by exploratory data analysis with Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends, seasonality, and residuals. Stationarity of the time series was tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test from statsmodels, and differencing was applied to stabilize the series. ACF and PACF plots guided the selection of ARIMA (p,d,q) parameters. ARIMA models were trained using statsmodels, and future exchange rates were forecasted. Model performance was evaluated using scikit-learn metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), and predictive insights were visualized through dynamic Python dashboards to support real-time, data-driven financial decision-making.
